# stocks-demo

This demo implements classes for managing stock data.  Stock data is hard-coded in one implementation ('BasicStockService') and stored on a database in others ('DatabaseStockService' and 'DatabasePersonService').  Database is accessed via Hibernate database configuration relying on the existence of a database called 'stocks' granting all privileges to user 'monty' with password 'some_pass'.
